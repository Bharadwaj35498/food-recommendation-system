#Aware Food Recommendation System

A human-centric machine learning project that recommends food based on user mood, time of day, hunger level, diet preference, weather conditions, health goals, and spice tolerance.

This project demonstrates practical ML thinking by modeling how humans actually make food choices rather than focusing only on historical data.

---

## Why This Project
People often struggle to decide what to eat, and their choices depend on context rather than fixed preferences.  
This system mimics real-life decision-making by incorporating multiple contextual factors into the recommendation process.

Example scenarios:
- Stressed + Night + Rainy → Comfort food  
- Morning + Weight loss goal → Light meal  

---

## Machine Learning Approach

- Problem Type: Context-aware classification
- Model: Decision Tree Classifier
- Reason for model choice:
  - Handles categorical features well
  - Interpretable and explainable
  - Suitable for small and synthetic datasets

---

## Features Used

- Mood (happy, tired, stressed, sad)
- Time of Day (morning, afternoon, night)
- Hunger Level (low, medium, high)
- Diet Preference (veg / non-veg)
- Weather (hot, cold, rainy)
- Health Goal (weight loss, muscle gain, maintenance)
- Spice Level (low, medium, high)

---

## Output

- Food Category:
  - Light meal
  - Snack
  - Heavy meal
  - Comfort food

---

## Dataset Strategy

- Initial real dataset was limited
- Synthetic data was generated using rule-based heuristics to improve training stability
- Synthetic data is used only for prototyping purposes

---

## Application

The system is deployed as an interactive Streamlit web application where users can:
- Select contextual inputs via dropdowns
- Receive instant food recommendations
- Experience an end-to-end ML pipeline

---

##Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- Git & GitHub
